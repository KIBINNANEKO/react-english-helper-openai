# react-english-helper-openai

"Mystic Teacher" - my own mini-project aimed at developing an interface that will interact with the Chat GPT model to assist in learning the English language.

Development stages:

1. Create the design project from scratch in Figma;
2. Implement three pages (welcome, topic selection, dialogue) and components, and set up the interaction with React;
3. Create a simple Node.js server and connect the Chat GPT model, configure prompts, and interaction methods using the openai library.

Features:
1. There was no need for using a state manager;
2. Please be lenient when judging the code quality on the server-side since my specialization is frontend development, and I couldn't implement my idea without the server.

Future plans for additions:
1. Animations;
2. Ability to save dialogues for reviewing the material;
3. Generate possible response options after each message and display them as tags, clicking on which would send the message to the model;
4. Implement light/dark themes;
5. Add error handling and notify the user about them.

Technology stack:
1. HTML, SCSS-modules;
2. JavaScript;
3. React;
4. Node.js + openai library;
5. Figma (design).
